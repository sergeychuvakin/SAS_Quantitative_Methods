# Intro to Inferential statistics

## What the first of data analysis?

```{r packages}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r Data_obtainment}
## do not forget to check default paths
getwd()
setwd('/Users/serge/Desktop/SAS_QM/SAS_Quantitative_Methods/week5')
df <- read.csv('insurance 2.csv')
```

## What next?

```{r}
head(df)
```
## Let's create questions to answer them using t-test and ANOVA

1) ...
2) ...
3) ...

```{r}
dim(df)
```
```{r}
names(df)
```


```{r}
hist(df$age)
```

```{r}
#hist(df$sex, freq = T)
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex)) + geom_bar()
```
```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bmi)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```
What else you want to explore?....

## Box plots

```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = bmi)) + geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
summary(df$bmi)
```


```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = sex, color = sex)) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = sex, color = smoker)) + geom_boxplot()
```


## sometimes it's hopeless

```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = children, y = smoker )) + geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}

## NOTE: typical poisson distribution 
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = children)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15)
```

```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = charges, y = sex, color = sex)) + geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = charges, y = sex, color = smoker)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Interesting!

Let's check it usign statistics

## Tests
 - binom test 
 - t-test
 - ANOVA
 - correlation
 
### Binom test
Statistical measure for testing that vector have certain probability if success.

H0 - distribution matches set probability
H1 - distribution diverge set probability

p-value <= 0.05 we can reject HO, we cannot reject H1

```{r}
NUMBER_OF_SUC <- 1
NUMBER_OF_TRIALS <- 10
DESIRED_PROBABILTY <- 0.5 #### (from 0 to 1)


binom.test(NUMBER_OF_SUC, NUMBER_OF_TRIALS, DESIRED_PROBABILTY)
```

### T-test

Statistical measure for testing if means of two vector significantly different.

H0 - Two mean are not really different 
H1 - Two mean are different 

p-value <= 0.05 we can reject HO, we cannot reject H1

```{r}
?t.test
a <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 10)
b <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 10)

t.test(a, b)
```

Let's try real example!!

```{r}
## Easy way to write formula
t.test(df$bmi ~ df$sex) 
```

How it works? Let's replicate it.

```{r}
a <- df %>% 
  filter(sex == 'male') %>% 
  pull(bmi)

b <- df %>% 
  filter(sex == 'female') %>% 
  pull(bmi)

t.test(a, b)
```

Absolutely the same. 

Let's check out H1 about smokers and insurance wastes!

NB: check:
1) are vectors dependent?
2) distribution of target variable
3) check homogeneity of variances (?var.test)

```{r}
### Our code here 
```


### ANOVA

Why do we need it? Guess we to check H1 about region influence? 

What Analysis Of Variance is? 

Statistical measure for testing if means of two or more (sic!) vector significantly different.

H0 - Means are not really different 
H1 - Means are different 

p-value <= 0.05 we can reject HO, we cannot reject H1

```{r}
aov(df$charges~df$region)
```


### Chi-square 

Statistical measure for testing if means of two or more (sic!) vector significantly different.

H0 - Distribution in matrix is uniform 
H1 - Distribution in matrix is NOT (!sic) uniform 

```{r}
df %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = smoker, # what would be in rows
                     names_from = sex, # what columns would be split
                     values_from = charges, # what values will be filled
                     values_fn = mean) # what function will applied
```



### Correlations

Do not returns p-value! It's just a measure just to detect alike vectors. 

Value should be above 0.6 if sample is big, but it could be less in small samples. 

Note! Very important! Matrix can be changed if you add here highly correlrated vector - probably some correlation would vanish, while some won't. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor 
```
